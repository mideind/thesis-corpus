This is a collection of scripts to collect and process pdf files from the open access repositories Skemman and Hirslan.

main.py : The entry point for scraping and processing Skemman.
    Run with -h to get some help.

main-hirslan.py : The entry point for scraping and processing Hirslan.
    This is a rewrite and simplification of the Skemman program.
    It does not have -h, but is hopefully easier to understand.
    It should work on Skemman with some adjustments in the breadcrumb code (not tested yet).

requirements.txt and requirements-hirslan.txt: Python environment lists from pip for main.py and main-hirslan.py respectively. 

Both of these scripts will create a data folder and work inside that. If you're running them both, take care that you might not want them to be mixed.

annotator/ is a tool for marking lines good or bad. This is hopefully useful for further processing of text.

Some of the .py files can be executed to run simple test cases. This was mostly used for development and not for testing rigor.
